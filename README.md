# yml-List-Reformatter
 This is a simple project made to reformat large lists of text by adding "  - " before every line. 
 I created this simple script to avoid having to manually add a hyphen and the proper spacing before 
 every element of a list in a YML file.


 EXAMPLE:
 A
 B
 C
 Becomes ->
   - A
   - B
   - C
 USAGE:
   - Copy the contents of your list into RawList.txt OR import your file into the project src
   - After loading the script in a terminal or command window, enter the content root path of the file 
     you wish to reformat into the scanner and press enter
   - Your reformatted file will be updated under ReformattedList.txt, your original file will not be altered in any way
